# Projects description
Solving the Lane-Emden Equation. This project will estimate the dimensionless radius (ξ) that is corrseponding to a range of polytropic indices n (from n=0 to n=4)

<h4>Required Python Packages</h4>	
The required Python packages: matplotlib.pyplot and numpy.

<h2>How to download this project</h2>

<h3>How to run this project</h3>	
After you have donwloaded the file, unzip it and open the file in your terminal. Type 'python Lane-Emden-equation.py' to run the project. The result will include the values of ξ (xi), the corresponding gradients and its n values (polytropic indices). The relationship between Theta and xi will also be shown as a separate graph (from n = 0 to n = 5).

<h3>Note</h3>	
This program was written in Python and tested only in Python 2.7.
